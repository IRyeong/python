This is a simple job scrapper made with python.

It scrapes up jobs from stackoverflow, remoteok, and weworkremotely websites.

I used Flask, python, and html to make it work.

This is the first page.

And this is when I search jobs for 'python'.

You can make a csv file with the 'Export to CSV' button.

This works in 2022.1.22.
